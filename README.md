# QPSL Engine: An Integrated Physical Simulation Engine

### Intellectual Property Rights: IMEDxAB

## Introduction

**QPSL** is more than a programming language; it is a **live simulation platform**. In this world, every object is a physical entity that knows its properties, from the atoms of an engine to raindrops. Our goal is to empower developers to build incredibly realistic worlds without the need for complex physics code.

## Core Capabilities

* **Inherent Physics:** No need to write complex code for probabilities. QPSL automatically simulates **friction, aerodynamics, and fluid dynamics**, ensuring every interaction is realistic.
* **Living Environment:** Objects like water, wind, and even the sun are treated as independent entities with their own physical properties, giving your world a sense of dynamic realism.
* **Tiered Precision:** Choose the level of detail that fits your project. You can work on a **Macro-Tier** for games, a **Meso-Tier** for engineering designs, or a **Micro-Tier** for precise materials research.
* **Intelligent Control:** The language can receive player inputs or control objects via AI algorithms, making it perfect for both games and autonomous systems.

## The Full Game Code: A Demonstration of QPSL's Power

This isn't just a game; it's an accurate simulation of a historical event. In 2025, the Bahrain International Circuit saw an exciting race under a sudden rainstorm. Using QPSL, we have recreated this event in all its physical detail.

### 1. The World and Its Reality

Building Cars and Drivers
```qpsl
// QPSL automatically pulls all physical data for the track and its environment.
// There is no need to define dimensions, as the track is an object that knows its properties.
call (track_map) from "Bahrain International Circuit";
call (weather) from "Realtime_Weather_2025-08-20_17:00:00"; // Call the actual weather conditions

// Spectators are not just models; they are objects that interact with the race.
build (crowd) as "Grand_Prix_Spectators";
 // Every car and driver is a living object; QPSL understands their properties automatically.
build (car) as "Mercedes-AMG_GT" with (
    engine: V8_TwinTurbo,
    horsepower: 515hp,
    weight: 1625kg
);

build (car) as "BMW_M4_Competition" with (
    engine: Inline-6_TwinTurbo,
    horsepower: 503hp,
    weight: 1725kg
);

build (car) as "Ferrari_488_GTB" with (
    engine: V8_TwinTurbo,
    horsepower: 661hp,
    weight: 1370kg
);

// Building the human player and AI opponents
build (driver) as "Human" with (id: "IMEDxAB");
build (driver) as "Pro_Racer" with (name: "Alex_The_Ace", skills: { braking_skill: 9.5, cornering_skill: 9.0 });
build (driver) as "Unpredictable_Racer" with (name: "Rookie_Joe", skills: { braking_skill: 4.0, cornering_skill: 5.5 });
The Simulation and Control

// Link players and AI to their cars
receive (player) with (id: "IMEDxAB") > (driver) (car: Mercedes_AMG_GT);
ctl (Pro_Racer) > (drive) (car: BMW_M4_Competition);
ctl (Unpredictable_Racer) > (drive) (car: Ferrari_488_GTB);

// Start the simulation. QPSL handles everything: rain, physics, and competitors.
simulate (race) with (start_time: "17:00", duration: "1 hour");

// Keyboard inputs are linked to control commands for the human player
ctl (Human_driver) > (accelerate) on (keyboard.key_W);
ctl (Human_driver) > (brake) on (keyboard.key_S);
ctl (Human_driver) > (steer) left on (keyboard.key_A);
ctl (Human_driver) > (steer) right on (keyboard.key_D);
​Beyond the Game: The True Value of QPSL
​This race is a small window into the capabilities of QPSL. The true value of the language lies in its ability to:
​Engineering: Test new materials in a virtual environment without the need for expensive laboratories.
​Scientific Research: Simulate complex chemical and physical reactions to achieve new discoveries.
​Manufacturing: Design and test models of complete industrial products (like cars and aircraft) in a safe and efficient environment.
​QPSL Engine is your gateway to a world where code doesn't just tell things what they should be—it gives them the power to be.
