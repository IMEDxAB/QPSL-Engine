// ** QPSL Engine: Complex AI Character **
// This code demonstrates how to build a character with psychological traits
// and integrate it into a simulation environment.

program "Psychological_Profile_Simulation" with (
    // 1. Building the Main Character Entity
    // This part defines the basic psychological traits that will govern the character's actions
    build (character_type) as "Joker_Psychotype" with (
        id: "unique_Joker_entity",
        name: "Joker",
        behavior_model: "Psychological_Profile"
    );

    // 2. Spawning the Object and Integrating It into the Environment
    // This part places the character inside the game world (like Cyberpunk)
    spawn (Joker_instance) as "Living_Entity" with (
        model: "Joker_The_Series",
        driver: (character_type),
        position: {x: 150, y: 30, z: -50},
        environment: "Cyberpunk_City_District"
    );

    // 3. Controlling the Character's Intelligent Behavior
    // This part links the character's behavior to the specified psychological model

        mode: "psychological_profile",

    // Here, you can add commands to make the character interact with events and the environment

            trigger (behavior: "Heighten_Chaos");

        on_event: (Joker_instance observes "Police_Presence") then (
            trigger (behavior: "Taunt_And_Provoke");
        )
    );

    // 5. Rendering
    // To ensure the character and its interactions are displayed within the scene
    render (scene) as (visual: "3D_Render") with (
        camera: (follow: Joker_instance)
    );
);
